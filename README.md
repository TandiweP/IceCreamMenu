# IceCreamMenu

![Image](horrormoviesnapshot.png)

# Description: 
Vanilla Js and Vanilla Ice Cream meet to bring you a delightful menu.  The features include a price list, order form, flavor request form, and css animation. 

# Purpose
The main focus of this was to explore and implement modern CSS uses.

# Future Improvements: 
1. The flavor buttons on the homescreen are misaligned
2. Do more work on the css animation of the ice cream going into the cone 
3. Add JS that works with the DOM to diplay current orders.
